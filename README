NAME
    MooseX::FollowPBP - Name your accessors get_foo() and set_foo()

SYNOPSIS
        use MooseX::FollowPBP;
        use Moose;

        # make some attributes

DESCRIPTION
    This module does not provide any methods. Simply loading it changes the
    default naming policy for the loading class so that accessors are
    separated into get and set methods. The get methods are prefixed with
    "get_" as the accessor, while set methods are prefixed with "set_". This
    is the naming style recommended by Damian Conway in *Perl Best
    Practices*.

    If you define an attribute with a leading underscore, then both the get
    and set method will also have an underscore prefix.

    If you explicitly set a "reader" or "writer" name when creating an
    attribute, then that attribute's naming scheme is left unchanged.
